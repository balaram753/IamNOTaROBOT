# reCAPTCHA Verification Implementation

A custom implementation of reCAPTCHA verification with a user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates how to create a reCAPTCHA-like verification system that can be integrated into web applications.

## Features

- Custom reCAPTCHA-like verification UI
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Visual feedback during verification process
- Clipboard integration for verification codes

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing the reCAPTCHA implementation
- `recaptcha-verify` - Verification window implementation (HTA application)

## How It Works

1. The main interface displays a checkbox with "I'm not a robot" text
2. When clicked, it shows a verification window
3. The system performs verification in the background
4. Upon successful verification, it provides feedback to the user

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/balaram753/IamNOTaROBOT.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the implementation

## Customization

You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS in the `index.html` file. The following aspects can be customized:

- Colors and fonts
- Button styles
- Animation timings
- Verification window appearance

## Browser Compatibility

This implementation should work on all modern web browsers including:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari
